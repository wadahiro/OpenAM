/**
 * This enum is passed to all TokenValidator implementations. TokenValidator implementations are responsible for
 * caching the OpenAM session identifiers corresponding to the validated token, as well as information concerning
 * whether this OpenAM session should be invalidated once any output token is generated. In the soap-sts case, in
 * support of delegated token validation (ActAs/OnBehalfOf as defined in WS-Trust), an OpenAM session identifier will
 * result from the validation of this delegated token, which is potentially in addition to the validation which will
 * occur as the result of SecurityPolicy binding enforcement. This OpenAM session id must be cached in a different
 * location, so it may be referenced when a SenderVouches SAML2 assertion is generated. This enum allows the various
 * validation contexts to be communicated to TokenValidator implementations, so that they can cache an OpenAM session
 * ids in the correct location.
