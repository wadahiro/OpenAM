/**
 * This package contains classes related to creating the json payloads corresponding to REST-STS and TokenGenerationService
 * invocations. These classes allows these invocations to be constituted programmatically, and also allows the REST-STS
 * and TokenGenerationService to unmarshall json invocations into java objects.
 *
 * The builder pattern is followed throughout to support a fluent idiom, and to allow for the flexible addition of additional
 * state to the various token types.
 *
 * Some of the classes in this package, e.g. the ProofTokenState, are shared among the REST-STS and the TokenGenerationService.
 * I want to limit the dependencies between the sts constituent components, so the classes used to invoke the various services,
 * if shared between services, should be located in this package.
