/**
 * When issuing SAML2 Holder-of-Key assertions, the proof token is usually an X509Certificate. This state must be
 * specified in the invocation, both to the REST-STS, and in the call to the TokenGenerationService made by the
 * REST/SOAP STS. This is the analogue to the UseKey element in the WS-Trust defined RequestSecurityToken, which is
 * defined as 'generally used when the client supplies a public-key that it wishes to be embedded in T as the proof key.'
 * See http://docs.oasis-open.org/ws-sx/ws-trust/v1.4/errata01/os/ws-trust-1.4-errata01-os-complete.html for details.
 * The CXF-STS parses out the KeyInfo element included in the UseKey to create the org.apache.cxf.sts.request.ReceivedKey
 * which encapsulates this public key. Thus the SOAP-STS can use this ReceivedKey to constitute the ProofTokenState,
 * and the REST-STS will be invoked with the json representation of this class, which can then be forwarded on to the
 * TokenGenerationService when SAML2 HoK tokens are being issued.
 *
 * Note that the WS-Trust spec allows for the UseKey to include symmetric key information, resulting in a SAML2 HoK with
 * a KeyInfo element which contains symmetric key information. The TokenGenerationService and the REST-STS will not
 * support proof tokens based on symmetric key information for the moment.
 *
 * It may be that PublicKey based proof tokens need to be supported in the future. If so, this class will add a ctor
 * which takes a PublicKey, and encode which sort of proof-token-state has been provided (e.g. X509Certificate or PublicKey).
