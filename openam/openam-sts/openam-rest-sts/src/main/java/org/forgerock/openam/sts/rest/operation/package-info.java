/**
 * Contains classes related to the creation and implementation of token transformation operations, factory classes
 * that produce the RestTokenValidator and RestTokenProvider implementations which realize a particular token transform,
 * and marshalling classes that marshal the token transform invocation state into the parameter state needed by the
 * RestTokenValidator and RestTokenProvider implementations.
 *
 * Token transformation and token translation can be considered synonyms - different names were chosen to distinguish
 * the top-level operation(TokenTransformOperation), and the set of specific TokenTransform instances, each of which
 * validates a specific input token type and generates a specific output token type.
