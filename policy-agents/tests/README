This directory contains the unit tests for OpenAM Web Policy Agent.

Tests are placed in C source files and will look something like the following.  
Let us assume this is the file test_blah.c:




#include <relevant-headers.h>

/**
 * Test the blah functionality.
 */
void test_blah1(void** state) {
    
    // avoids "state not used" messages
    (void)state;
    
    assert_int_equal(AM_OK, AM_OK);

    // etc.
}

void test_blah2(void** state) {

    // etc. etc.
}


Make target "test_includes", which is a part of a global "tests" target, extracts
all of the test method prototypes from each of the test files and creates "tests.h" 
header file. The same target automatically creates "struct CMUnitTest tests[]" object 
to be used inside test_MAIN cmocka_run_group_tests().

Resulting test executable "test" is available under "build" directory.
