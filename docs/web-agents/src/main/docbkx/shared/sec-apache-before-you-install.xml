 <title>Before You Install</title>

 <para>
  First, avoid installing the web server and the web policy agent
  as root. Instead, create a web server user and install as that user.
 </para>
 <para>
  If you cannot avoid installing the web server and web policy agent as root,
  then you must give all users read and write permissions to the
  <filename>logs</filename> and <filename>logs/debug</filename> directories under
  the agent instance directory
  (<filename>/path/to/web_agents/<replaceable>type</replaceable>/Agent_<replaceable>number</replaceable>/logs/</filename>).
  Otherwise, the web policy agent fails with an error when attempting to rotate
  log files.
 </para>

 <para>Next, make sure OpenAM is installed and running, so that you can contact OpenAM
  from the system running the policy agent.
 </para>

 <para>
  Next, create a profile for your policy agent as described in
  <link
   xlink:show="new"
   xlink:href="web-users-guide#chap-web-agents"
   xlink:role="http://docbook.org/xlink/role/olink"
   ><citetitle>Configuring Web Policy Agent Profiles</citetitle></link>.
 </para>

 <para>
  To protect resources with the agent, create
  at least one policy as described in the section on <link
  xlink:href="${serverDocBase}/admin-guide/#configure-authz-policy"
  xlink:show="new"><citetitle>Configuring
  Policies</citetitle></link>. Consider creating a simple policy, such as a
  policy that allows only authenticated users to access your resources.
  This allows you to test your policy agent after installation.</para>

 <para>You must install Apache HTTP Server before you install the policy
  agent, and you must stop the server during installation.</para>

 <!--
  I had to install PCRE, and add APR and APR-util to the Apache HTTPD
  sources in order to get 2.4 installed. See the notes at
  http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/install.html. This was on Ubuntu
  12.04 desktop.

 <para>Unzip the file in the directory where you plan to install the web
  policy agent. The agent you install stores its configuration and logs
  under this directory.</para>

 <para>When you unzip the policy agent .zip download, you find the following
  directories:</para>
