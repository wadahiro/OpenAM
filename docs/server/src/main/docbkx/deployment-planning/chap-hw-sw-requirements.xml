  <para>
   This section considers storage requirements
   for OpenAM server, OpenAM policy agents, and OpenIG gateway.
  </para>

   <title>Server Storage Requirements</title>

   <indexterm class="startofrange" xml:id="idx-svr-storage">
    <primary>storage requirements</primary>
    <secondary>server storage</secondary>
   </indexterm>

   <para>
    Storage requirements for OpenAM servers depend
    partly on OpenAM itself and partly on your deployment. Storage requirements
    also depend on the
    space needed for binaries and configuration data,
    space for log files and rate of writes for logs,
    space for directory data and file system requirements
    when using an embedded OpenDJ directory server.
   </para>

   <itemizedlist>
    <para>
     For initial installation, a few hundred MB is sufficient,
     not including the downloaded files.
    </para>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      The OpenAM <literal>.war</literal> file size varies from release to release,
      but if your container holds one <literal>.war</literal> file
      and one directory with the contents of the <literal>.war</literal> file,
      the disk space required is on the order of 300 MB.
     </para>

     <para>
      This space requirement remains stable as you use OpenAM.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      The OpenAM configuration directory initially fits
      in approximately 50 MB of disk spaces
      including the embedded OpenDJ directory server.
     </para>

     <para>
      This space requirement grows as you use OpenAM.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </itemizedlist>

   <para>
    By default, OpenAM servers write logs to flat files under
    <filename><replaceable>config-dir</replaceable>/openam/logs/</filename>
    and <filename><replaceable>config-dir</replaceable>/openam/debug/</filename>.
    Alternatively, OpenAM servers can write logs to a database.
    For details, see the <citetitle>Administration Guide</citetitle> section,
    <link
     xlink:show="new"
     xlink:href="${docSetBaseURL}admin-guide/#log-mgmt"
     ><citetitle>Log Management</citetitle></link>.
   </para>

   <para>
    When using flat-file logging,
    OpenAM lets you configure rotation and purging
    for logs under <filename>openam/logs/</filename>,
    so you can effectively cap the maximum disk space used for logs.
    For details, see the configuration <citetitle>Reference</citetitle> section,
    <link
     xlink:show="new"
     xlink:href="${docSetBaseURL}reference/#system-logging"
     ><citetitle>Logging</citetitle></link>.
    Make sure, however, that you retain the information you need
    before logs are purged.
    Also make sure that your disk can keep pace with the volume of logging,
    which can be significant in high volume deployments,
    as OpenAM logs not only errors, but also access messages.
   </para>

   <para>
    OpenAM also lets you configure rotation
    for logs under <filename>openam/logs/debug</filename>.
    As you can change debug log levels at runtime when investigating issues,
    debug log volume is not as predictable as for regular logs.
    Leave a margin in production environments,
    so that you can turn up debug log levels to diagnose problems.
   </para>

   <itemizedlist>
    <para>
     When using the embedded OpenDJ directory server, take the following into
     account:
    </para>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      OpenDJ is designed to work with local storage for the database, but
      not for network file system (NFS) nor network-attached storage (NAS) due
      to some file system locking functions that OpenDJ needs.
      High performance storage, like solid state drives (SSD), is essential
      if you need to handle high write throughput.
     </para>

     <para>
      By default, OpenAM's configuration directory resides
      under the $HOME directory of the user running the container.
      $HOME directories can be mounted over the network.
     </para>

     <para>
      This is not an issue if you are using OpenDJ mainly for configuration data.
      It can however be a serious problem
      when you use OpenDJ to back the CTS
      in a high-volume deployment.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Embedded OpenDJ directory server log files are stored under
      <filename><replaceable>config-dir</replaceable>/opends/logs/</filename>.
      As for OpenAM, you can configure OpenDJ directory server
      log rotation and purging.
      The default cap for access logs is 2 GB.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      OpenAM stores policy information in the configuration directory.
      The space this takes up depends on the policies you have.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      By default, OpenAM stores CTS information in the configuration directory.
      The space this takes up depends on the volume of traffic to the server.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      With the default database implementation,
      OpenDJ database files handling sustained writes
      can grow to about double their initial size on disk.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      For OpenDJ on Linux systems,
      enable file system write barriers and ensure the file system
      journaling mode is ordered to avoid directory database file corruption
      after crashes or power failures.
      For details on enabling write barriers
      and setting the journaling mode for data,
      see the options for your file system
      in the <command>mount</command> command manual page.
     </para></listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      OpenDJ directory server uses file descriptors when handling connections.
     </para>

     <para>
      Defaults can be limited to 1024 file descriptors per user on Linux systems.
      Consider increasing this limit to at least 64K.
      For details, see the <citetitle>Installation Guide</citetitle> section,

   <title>Policy Agent Storage Requirements</title>

   <indexterm>
    <primary>policy agents</primary>
    <secondary>storage requirements</secondary>
   </indexterm>

   <para>
    Policy agents are implemented as libraries or Web applications,
    and so tend to be small on disk, not more than a few MB.
   </para>

   <para>
    You can configure policy agents to perform local logging to files,
    or to send log messages to OpenAM for remote logging.
    For details, see the <citetitle>Configuration Reference</citetitle>
    for your policy agent.
   </para>

   <para>
    Debug messages are logged to local files, however, not remotely.
    Debug logging volume depends on log level.
    As for OpenAM, leave a margin in production environments
    so that you can turn up debug log levels to diagnose problems.

   <title>OpenIG Storage Requirements</title>

   <indexterm>
    <primary>OpenIG</primary>
    <secondary>storage requirements</secondary>
   </indexterm>

   <para>
    The OpenIG Web application can vary in size from release to release.
    On disk the <literal>.war</literal> file is under 50 MB.
    For containers that keep both the <literal>.war</literal> file and an unpacked version,
    the total size is under 100 MB.
   </para>

   <para>
    By default, OpenIG configuration resides
    under the $HOME directory of the user who runs the container.
   </para>

   <para>
    If you use the default log sink,
    messages are sent to the container logs.
    Manage those as you would any container logs.
   </para>

   <para>
    Capture logging and any logging you perform from scriptable filters and handlers
    can potentially generate significant write traffic.
    Furthermore, OpenIG does not run rotation or purging for such logs.
    You must manage any logs OpenIG generates
    using a <literal>CaptureFilter</literal> or log messages from scriptable
    filters and handlers.
   </para>

   <para>
    Both normal log messages and debug messages go to the log sink.
    As for other components, debug logging volume depends on log level.
    Leave a margin in production environments
    so that you can turn up debug log levels to diagnose problems.
   </para>

   <itemizedlist>
    <para>
     The following are based on the preceding information in this section.
     When deciding on storage, keep the following recommendations in mind:
    </para>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Plan enough space and enough disk I/O
      to comfortably absorb the load for logs.
     </para>

     <para>
      Check your assumptions in testing.
      For example, make sure that logs are cleaned up
      so that they do not exceed your space threshold
      even in long-duration testing.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      For deployments where an embedded OpenDJ directory service
      handles high throughput,
      make sure you use a local file system
      and that the user running the container has enough file descriptors.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      When using local policy agent logs,
      make sure you have a mechanism in place to clean them up.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      For OpenIG, make sure you turn off <literal>CaptureFilter</literal> logging,
      scriptable filter, and handler debug logging
      before moving to production.
     </para>

  <para>
   The following sections list hardware and software
   requirements for deploying OpenAM server and policy agent software.
  </para>

  <para>
   OpenAM core services require a minimum JVM heap size of 1 GB, and a permanent
   generation size of 256 MB. If you are including the embedded OpenDJ directory,
   OpenAM requires at least a 2 GB heap, as 50% of that space is allocated to OpenDJ.
  </para>

  <note>
   <para>
    Ensure that the <literal>Xms</literal> and <literal>Xmx</literal> JVM
    parameters are set to the same value to prevent a large garbage collection
    as the memory profile increases from the default up to the <literal>Xms</literal> value.
    Also, setting <literal>Xms</literal> and <literal>Xmx</literal> to the same value
    ensures that small controlled garbage collection events minimize
    application unresponsiveness.
