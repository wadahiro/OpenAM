   <para><emphasis role="bold">Stateless Sessions</emphasis></para>
   <para>
    OpenAM supports two types of sessions: <firstterm>stateful</firstterm> and
    <firstterm>stateless</firstterm>.
   </para>
   <para>
    Stateful sessions are sessions that reside in the OpenAM server's memory
    and, if session failover is enabled, are also persisted in the Core Token
    Service's token store. Stateful sessions have been the only session type
    supported in previous OpenAM releases.
   </para>
   <para>
    OpenAM ${serverDocTargetVersion} also supports a new type of
    session: the stateless session. Stateless sessions are sessions in which
    state information is encoded in OpenAM and sent to clients, but the
    information from the sessions is not retained in OpenAM's memory.
    For browser-based clients, OpenAM sets a cookie in the browser that
    contains the session state. When the browser transmits the cookie back to
    OpenAM, OpenAM decodes the session state from the cookie.
   </para>
   <para>
    Stateless sessions can be used for deployments when elasticity is required,
    for example, cloud deployments in which the server load varies. You can add
    and remove OpenAM servers to and from a site and the stateless session load
    should balance horizontally.
