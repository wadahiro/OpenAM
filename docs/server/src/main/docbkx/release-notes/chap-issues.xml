  <title>Limitations</title>

  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Limitations on Deployments Using Stateless
     Sessions</emphasis>. Several OpenAM features require stateful sessions,
     and do not work in realms configured for stateless sessions.
     See <link
          xlink:show="new"
          xlink:href="admin-guide#session-state-stateless-limitations"

    <para><emphasis role="bold">Different OpenAM Version within a Site</emphasis>.
     Do not run different versions of OpenAM together in the same OpenAM
     site.</para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Deleting Referral Policy</emphasis>.
     OpenAM allows you to delete a referral policy
     even if policies depending on the referral still exist in the target realm.
     Deleting a referral policy that other policies depend on
     can cause problems during policy evaluation.
     You must therefore make sure that no policies
     depend on any referrals that you delete.
    </para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para><emphasis role="bold">Avoid Use of Special Characters in Policy or
     Application creation</emphasis>.
     Do not use special characters within policy, application or referral names
     (for example, "my+referral") using the Policy Editor or REST endpoints as
     OpenAM returns a 400 Bad Request error.
     The special characters are: double quotes ("), plus sign (+), command (,),
     less than (&lt;), equals (=), greater than (&gt;), backslash (\), and null (\u0000).

     Realm Names</emphasis>.
     Do not use the names of OpenAM REST endpoints as the name of a realm.
     The OpenAM REST endpoint names that should not be used includes: "users",
     "groups", "realms", "policies" and "applications".

    <para><emphasis role="bold">Enforcing Session Quotas with Session Failover</emphasis>.
     By default OpenAM does not enforce session quotas when running in Site
     mode without session failover. To work around this behavior, set the server
     configuration property
     <literal>openam.session.useLocalSessionsInMultiServerMode=true</literal>.
     You can set this property in OpenAM console under Configuration &gt; Servers
     and Sites &gt; Servers &gt; Server Name &gt; Advanced.</para>

     On hosts with pure IPv6 networks, OpenAM configuration has been seen to fail

     The <literal>HttpServletResponse</literal> instance passed to

     OpenAM can only import XACML 3.0 files that were either created by an
