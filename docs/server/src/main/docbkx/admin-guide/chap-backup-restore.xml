 <title>Backing Up and Restoring OpenAM Configurations</title>

 <para>
  OpenAM stores configuration data in an LDAP directory server and in files.
  The directory service replicates configuration data between directory servers,
  allowing OpenAM to share configuration data across servers in a Site.
  During normal production operations, you rely on directory replication
  to maintain multiple, current copies of OpenAM service configuration.
  To recover from the loss of a server or from a serious administrative error,
  back up directory data and configuration files.
 </para>

 <para>
  This chapter shows how to backup and restore OpenAM configuration data
  by backing up and restoring local configuration files
  and local (embedded) configuration directory server data.
  If your deployment uses an external configuration directory server,
  then refer to the documentation for your external directory server
  or work with your directory server administrator to back up and restore
  configuration data stored in the external directory service.
 </para>

 <para>
  For OpenDJ directory server you can find more information in the chapter on

  ><citetitle>Backing Up &amp; Restoring Data</citetitle></link>.
 </para>

 <itemizedlist>
  <para>
   In OpenAM deployments where configuration directory data is replicated,
   you must take the following points into consideration.
  </para>

  <listitem>
   <para>
    Directory replication mechanically applies new changes to ensure
    that replicated data is the same everywhere.
    When you restore older backup data,
    directory replication applies newer changes to the older data.
   </para>

   <para>
    This includes new changes that the administrator sees as mistakes.
    To recover from administrative error, you must work around this behavior
    either by performing a change to be replicated that repairs the error
    or by restoring all replicas to a state prior to the error.
   </para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
   <para>
    When preparing directory server backup and restore operations,
    also know that data replication purge operations affect
    the useful lifetime of any data that you back up.
   </para>

   <para>
    Replication relies on historical data to resolve any conflicts that arise.
    If directory servers did not eventually purge this historical data,
    the data would continue to grow until it filled all available space.
    Directory servers therefore purge older historical data.
    OpenDJ purges historical data older than 3 days by default.
   </para>

   <para>
    When the directory server encounters a gap in historical data
    it cannot correctly complete replication operations.
    You must make sure, therefore, that any data you restore from backup
    is not older than the replication purge delay.
    Otherwise your restoration operation could break replication
    with the likely result that you must restore all servers from backup,
    losing any changes that occurred in the meantime.
